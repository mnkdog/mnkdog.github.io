        <h1>A 'Sliding Doors' moment, or is it?</h1>
        <p>This is not a tale of a pivotal moment and then the after effects.
It is not the point where I talk about an important decision I had to make and I could foresee some things that may follow on should I make the decision one way, and then what may happen if I made the decision the other way.  </p>

<p>These are situations where you know you stand before something momentous and are weighing up the pros and cons of choosing one option over others.  We could call this a quandary.</p>

<p>The thing is, this is not what is meant by a <a href="https://neuroalchemist.com/sliding-door/">Sliding Doors moment</a>.  The difference is quite striking because in the above <em>quandary</em> situation we <strong>know</strong> we have a big decision to make; we <strong>know</strong> there will be sizable repercussions following our decision.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are fully aware of the gravity of the situation we find ourself in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, a <em>Sliding Doors moment</em> is one where we are unaware we are at a pivotal juncture, that our fate will change after this moment.  We are just <em>being</em> or <em>doing</em> and only later can we look back and attribute the fact some later effect occurred to an innocuous decision we made earlier.  </p>

<p>The sliding doors moment in the film that originates the term is whether the character boards a train.  The film then shows two different life paths based on boarding and not boarding the train. Boarding the train meant the character arrived home in time to catch her cheating partner, which led to other decisions and a prosperous life.  Missing the train caused the character to arrive home too late to witness the infidelity, and then living an unhappy and less prosperous life with that partner. </p>

<p>There was no conscious decision to <em>not</em> board the train but the character was merely too late to make it onto the train.  This event would have been caused by earlier decisions, leading to the character arriving at the station too late.  So, again, the character did not <em>knowingly</em> stand before a turning point in her life.  She did not have a quandary whether to or not to catch the train.  It was just fate, one could say.</p>

<p>I like the Zig Ziglar quote on this, taken from the above-quoted article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your life is a result of the choices you have made. If you donâ€™t like your life, start making better choices.<em> - Zig Ziglar</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in likening our current situation to the sliding doors moment, often we are merely saying, <em>"I have a tough decision to make as either of the options I choose could lead me into the unknown, and I find this scary!"</em></p>
