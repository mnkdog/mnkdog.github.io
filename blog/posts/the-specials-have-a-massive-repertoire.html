        <h1>The Specials have a massive repertoire</h1>
        <p>I've liked The Specials for a long time now but I am not the kind of person to learn all about bands and artists, so I knew nothing about them.  In a way, I am bias free because I only go by what my ears know about them.  I've seen pictures of saxaphones flash by me on my music streaming app and CD covers but that's it.</p>
        <p>Today I realised they have so much more music than I'd ever heard, mainly because I am trying out YouTube Music instead of Spotify and it has played so many more tracks of theirs.</p>
