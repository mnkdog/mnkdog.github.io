        <h1>Testing role requirements impossible to fulfil</h1>
        <p>Back in the day, there was a distinct hierarchy to software testing jobs.
I'm talking about the 1990's when we had Test Analysts (in addition to Junior and Senior versions thereof).
You could then move up to being a Test Manager, if you worked on planned, waterfall, types of projects.
If you then progressed to overseeing organisational Testing or Quality Assurance then you could go for QA Manager roles.
There was a clear progression path and distinct roles.
QA Managers would not normally be expected to do any testing, and would line-manage their team of testers.</p>

<p>As time went by we saw the need for automation skills for a tester, and it was usually to automate regression tests.
Tools for this were off the shelf capture replay tools, such as Mercury Winrunner.
You could record some clicks through some software and the tool would churn out some code, like a macro.
This code could then be embellished to make it as reusable as you wanted.</p>

<p>During this period we saw the rise of mass software adoption and the need for performant systems was born.
Hence, performance testing tools were introduced, such as Mercury LoadRunner.</p>

<p>Again, tehcnical testers doing automation or performance testing were not required to do management; that was the Test Manager's or QA Manager's role.</p>

<p>The issue we have now is that the proliferation of iterative software development has largely negated the need for leaders or managers in  QA / testing.
We want <strong>doers</strong> and not <em>managers</em>.</p>

<p>This would all be fine if organisations ran their software development using collaborative teams using Continuous Integration and all the automated tests that this requires.
What we find though is that teams adopt the agile events, such as the stand-up, and organise themselves in cross functional units, but they still leave the testing to QA / test people.
Ultimately, we have ended up with just as many QA people as before but with no QA leadership or management.
To address this, companies now look for a person who can manage and set testing strategies in addition to writing automation frameworks, and everything in between.</p>

<p>In short, we thought we didn't need testers.
Then we realised we did, and built teams of them everywhere.
Then we went agile and got rid of test management and lots of testers.
Now testers are coming back but we don't want to pay for the management of them!</p>
