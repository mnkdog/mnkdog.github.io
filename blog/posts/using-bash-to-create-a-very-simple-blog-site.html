        <h1>Using bash to create a very simple blog site</h1>
        <p>So, what I did was create a very very simple website based on Bootsrap CSS.</p>
        <p>It has a homepage and a blog page.  The blog page just has links to blog posts.  Each blog post has links to all blog posts at the bottom after the blog content.  That's it.  In order though to easily create a new blog post I wrote a bash script that adds the before, after, and recent blogs html code.  That's it really.  Enjoy!</p>
