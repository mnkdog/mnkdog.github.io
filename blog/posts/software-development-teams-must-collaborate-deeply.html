        <h1>Software development teams must collaborate, deeply</h1>
        <p>I find, with many virtual concepts, such as computer software, that often people find it difficult to see what's going on and how the system operates.
This then means they are oblivious to things going wrong or that could simply benefit from improvement.
They are unable to see when a teammate needs help or when the output from the system (the product) isn't quite right.</p>

<p>By <em>system</em>, I mean the process, tasks, interactions; the way we organise ourselves in order to produce the software output.</p>

<p>If, for example, we take the production of wooden tables, assuming for now it is done by a team of humans together in a physical workshop, I will try to illustrate my thinking.
4 people working in this way together can see the progress that's been made and which stage we are at.
We can quickly lean across and help each other making legs or fixings or the table top itself.
We can refer back to designs and drawings and hold these up to the individual parts and the whole to see if it looks right.</p>

<p>Imagine if one of us takes an enormous chisel to the finished table top, thinking they'll use it to quickly remove a slight protruding imperfection, and then slips and damages the table.  We would all quickly know what happened.  We would see the damage and will know that large tool caused it - (what an unintentional pun). 
We would know what to do to remedy the situation, which would likely be some kind of wood filler to the gouge and then work to smoothen and finish it off.</p>

<p>Also imagine if one of us is struggling with how to use a particular tool in order to render the desired finish.
The rest of the team would see us using the wrong technique or holding the tool incorrectly.
They could then quickly show us how it's done and we'd be on our way with a new skill.</p>

<p>Now, imagine a team working on something intangible, such as software.
Each individual tends to work on their own, with their own tools (or at least their own instance of the tools), often without any collaboration.
None of their team mates can see anyone struggling with a tool and quickly jump in to help.
If any imperfections arise then the investigation is much more involved than a quick glance at a table and an incorrect tool laying near by.</p>

<p>Working with virtual products, software, is fraught with risks at all turns, and I believe this is largely because we work individually.
Working this way means we are only as good as the sum of our own skills and experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working extensively, individually, means we will be blinkered into thinking we're building the right thing in the right way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many other places to read about further disadvantages to this way of working and to also find the plus side to it.
For example, on our own we get to focus with no interruptions.  We won't get 'held back' helping those of lower skill in a particular task.</p>

<p>However, I think the pros massively outweigh the cons on this one.</p>

<p>Imagine if a table-making team worked individually.
Think about how things would turn out if they each worked in their own homes, 2 people producing the legs; one working on the table top; and one making the fixings for bolting it all together.  A small 'adjustment' by the leg maker won't be noticed until they next meet to assemble a table.  He may have made 40 such legs by this time.  We may find that the fixings don't match this new version of leg.</p>

<p>Well, this is what often happens in software teams.  We all meet up again (via an integration pipeline) only to find there are clashes and failing tests (if such things exist!). 
Two people came away from a meeting with 2 different understandings of the problem to solve and then went off to solve <em>their</em> version of it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collaboration helps negate misunderstandings, failure demand, and false implementations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do we collaborate in order to reap this particular miracle?
I like to think that when faced with <em>any</em> task there needs to be a good reason why it cannot be done collaboratively.</p>

<p>Thinking of product ideas? - Collaborate!</p>

<p>Creating the design? - Collaborate!</p>

<p>Thinking of acceptance criteria? - Collaborate!</p>

<p>Seeking the cause of a bug? - Collaborate!</p>

<p>Writing the code? - Collaborate!
This can be done using <em>Pairing</em> or <em>Mobbing</em>, for example.</p>

<p>Wanting to improve the team ways of working? - Collaborate!</p>

<p>Locating a Production issue so we can get our service back up and running!? - Collaborate!  Oh, what, you do that already as part of your incident response?
That's interesting!  When something is the most crucial and critical to the business, you gather people together and pull out all the stops to get it done.
Why not do that all the time and benefit from it on everything?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the <a href="/blog/posts/paretos-law-and-when-to-stop-testing.html">80/20 rule</a> at play.
Collaborating over incidents is giving us the 80% upside - we're at our most effective and efficient, however we only do this 20% of the time (well, much less if we're talking incidents, but you get the point!). </p>
