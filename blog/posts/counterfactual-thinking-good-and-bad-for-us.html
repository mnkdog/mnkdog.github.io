        <h1>Counterfactual thinking: good and bad for us</h1>
<p>In thinking about decisions while writing the <a href="/blog/posts/a-sliding-doors-moment-or-is-it.html">Sliding Doors moment post</a> it occurred to me that in mislabeling conscious turning points in one's life as a sliding doors moment we are usually weighing up pros and cons, or risks and rewards to taking a certain action.  We are looking into the perceived future and reflecting on how we may feel once the new reality hits us.  In other words, we are thinking, "will I regret this decision?".</p>

<p>This is when we begin to ruminate about what might have happened had we not taken <em>this</em> option but rather <em>that</em> option.  So, we are simulating the upsides and, more likely, the downsides of particular options.</p>

<p>In my mind, if you engage in this kind of thinking then you are also likely to be the kind of person who often looks back at situations with regret or "if only" thoughts.</p>

<p>This, like most concepts, has a defined term for it: <em>Counterfactual thinking</em>. </p>

<p>Counterfactual thinking is where we look back to the past and think, "I wish I hadn't done that", or "I'm glad I made that decision".</p>

<p>I am 100% in line with the second example; I never have regrets and believe I did the best I could with the knowledge, skills, time, and facilities I had <em>at the time</em>.
The important part, for me is: <strong>at the time</strong>. </p>

<p>We can all be wise after the event.  We all know what the best choice was once we've seen the light after the fact.</p>

<p>So, it turns out, I engage more in <em>Downward</em> counterfactual thinking, while the 'regretful' people focus more on <em>Upward</em> counterfactual thinking. 
The labeling of regretful and more negative thinking as <em>upward</em> seems counter-intuitive to me and confuses me each time I think about it.
Perhaps I need to research it more to discover why the terms were attributed this way around.</p>

<p>Why does any of this matter?</p>

<p>Well, there are positive effects of downward counterfactual thinking.  I won't go into those, though.</p>

<p>Plus, it is thought that upward counterfactual thinking is more associated with depression.  A study can be read <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735816301714">here</a>. </p>

<p>However, it isn't that simple.  Downward counterfactual thinking is not always good!
Some upward counterfactual thinking ("I wish had tried harder at work") is good.  If we take notice of it and learn from it, we may improve outcomes of similar situations in the future.  </p>

<p>So, I now have a name for what I've always been aware of about the way we look back on events and how we think about them.
I also have to be careful not to confuse <em>upward</em> (negative) with <em>downward</em> (positive)!</p>
