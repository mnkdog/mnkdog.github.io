        <h1>QA Testers to gain upper hand over software developers?</h1>
        <p>I read an article recently saying that AI (tools such as GitHub's Copilot) is going to erode the need for software developers while testers will be more in demand than ever!</p>

<p>This sounds inflammatory but there was some merit to the assertion, although life is never really that simple!</p>

<p>It was saying that today where a developer needs 2 days to produce some code, a tester then needs a day to do their QA tasks on it.
Then contrast that with using Copilot, and the same code could be produced in a few hours, while the tester still needs a day for their work.
The extraction then from this is that we'll need more testers than developers to keep up with the work!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The article sees the demand for QA people rising along with the salaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds great to the software QA population and champagne corks will soon be popping.
However, as with all life's man-made efficiencies and automation solutions, it usually means we expect even more to be achieved because part of what I did by hand before is now being done quicker by a machine.
It is likely that software developers will be relieved of doing some of these AI-automated tasks but will then have more time to spend on other human-centric work.
This could mean that designs could have more time spent on them or user interfaces could be even more polished, or more emphasis placed on system security or performance.</p>

<p>I see these labour-saving tools just freeing humans up to do more complex work - the work that knowledge workers tend to enjoy and is usually what they signed up for in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI in software development is akin to test automation in quality assurance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this light, AI for developers can be compared to the arrival (and recommended usage) of test automation tools for testers.
Their arrival heralded the end for <em>'manual'</em> testers while the robots take over.
Testers concerned for their livelihood scrambled to learn test automation, or be automated out of a job!</p>

<p>What we have seen, however, is these tools have aided a tester's work, enabling the human to use its cognitive power for complex tasks that a computer cannot perform. </p>

<p>I predict the same happening with AI tools for software engineers.</p>
