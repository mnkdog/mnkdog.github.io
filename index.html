        <p>
            Greetings, and welcome aboard.  As we all do, and cannot avoid doing, I learn stuff as I go through life.  This is a place where I 		reflect on experiences and write about them.  The topics will be varied, as will, no doubt, the quality!  If I describe, endorse, or recommend anything then please do your own homework before blindly accepting my 'truth'!
        </p>

            I enjoy creating websites and exploring new technologies.  I am also keen on human psychology and anything that makes our world revolve and influences the systems within which we exist.  With this blog, I aim to jot down topics and discoveries for my own benefit, so I do not have to relearn things.  If you find it useful then I am happy, too.
