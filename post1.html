        <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to my first blog post! This is where I share my thoughts and experiences on web development.
            Creating websites is a passion of mine, and today, I want to talk about the basics of building a simple 
            blog using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML provides the structure of the webpage, while CSS takes care of the design and layout. In this example,
            we are using a custom CSS file to apply styles similar to Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework, 
            but you can always customize your own styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stay tuned for more blog posts where I will dive into JavaScript, backend development, and more exciting topics!
